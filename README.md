# project_wake_me_up_Alarm
 Wake-Me-Up Alarm in Python.
 This is a small wake-me-up alarm that I built using Python. 
 The alarm helps you improve your productivity by dividing your time into three sessions: 25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of break, and 10 minutes of reflection. 
 The alarm plays a sound and shows a message at the end of each session. You can customize the sound and the message according to your preferences.
## Installation and Usage To install the alarm, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [here]. 
 You also need to install the pygame module, which you can do by running the command: pip install pygame To run the alarm, navigate to the project folder and run the command: python wake_me_up.py
 Configuration You can change the sound and the message of the alarm by editing the config.py file. 
 The file contains the following variables: - FOCUS_SOUND: The path to the sound file that plays at the end of the focus session. 
 - FOCUS_MESSAGE: The message that shows at the end of the focus session. - BREAK_SOUND: The path to the sound file that plays at the end of the break session.
 - - BREAK_MESSAGE: The message that shows at the end of the break session. - REFLECT_SOUND: The path to the sound file that plays at the end of the reflection session.
- REFLECT_MESSAGE: The message that shows at the end of the reflection session. You can use any sound file that is supported by pygame, such as .wav, .ogg, or .mp3. You can also use any text that you want for the messages.
